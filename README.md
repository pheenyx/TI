  I will send in Number 1,2 and 4. I have no intelligent idea for adressing a[i] in 3.

2013-01-14 23:55 MM
  Solved no.1 even if it is not fully optimized, but it should suffice.
  can't say if i will try no.3, that stuff takes forever and is just 20pts.

2013-01-14 20:30 MM
  Trying No.1. Not sure if I get to do something else maybe 3...

  Finished 8.2 completely, and drew the circuit of 8.1 from Robins sheets.
  You should be able to design the ringcountertables to match this circuit if
  you just use states from 000 to 111 for each number.

  Started working on 7.2 and 7.4. No idea how long it will take, but
  I'll definitely submit pdf-version tomorrow until 11:00. Paper-
  version would be nice too, check in the morning if you want.

  Our stupid homework is under GNU licence? Does it mean that every
  retard who copies it without mentioning our names actually breaks
  some funny laws? Awesome^^ :D

  Solved 7.1 and 7.3. I hope 7.1 is correct, it seemed too easy.

2013-12-05 01:55 AT
  Solved 6.2. The original statement looked like pile of bullcrap -.-

2013-12-04 16:27 AT
  Just looking around what I can do...
  Ok, I look at 6.2 first, and try to finish everything else
  (if something is still missing)

2013-12-02 22:20 MM
  done with 6.1 and done for today

2013-12-02 21:01 MM
  Starting with 6.1 and maybe 6.3

2013-11-21 20:49
  Done with 5.1a and b and 5.2
  If you are still on your generic java solver program, you can take a look
  if my solution is correct

2013-11-21 18:03
  Starting with number2
  And my solution for 1b. (1a is just ugly to draw)

2013-11-20 21:00
  sheet04 done!

  I had 4.3 on paper since the weekend. Just couldn't find the
  time to tex it. I will do so now.

2013-11-20 18:30
  Oooh damn, that stupid diagram took eternity -.-
  But admittedly, I've messed it up on first try...
  4.1 and 4.2 are done.
  Any progress on 4.3, anyone?

2013-11-20 16:50
  I just continue typing 4.2
  Any progress on 4.3?

2013-11-14 18:49
  Working on 4.2 Done 4.2 a,b,c. d is also basically solved, but only on paper,
  just have to type it, but it's not a problem, no need to do it twice. Please
  take a look at 4.3 already.

2013-11-14 18:00
  Synchronization notice: I'm working on 4.1, 4.2 looks good too.
  4.3 has too much badly written background story, I don't get it...
