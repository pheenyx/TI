  Synchronization notice: I'm working on 4.1, 4.2 looks good too.
  4.3 has too much badly written background story, I don't get it...

  Working on 4.2 Done 4.2 a,b,c. d is also basically solved, but only on paper, 
  just have to type it, but it's not a problem, no need to do it twice. Please
  take a look at 4.3 already.
